# Amaazon-Regional-Sales-analysis
Amaazon’s 2014–2018 sales data analysis


## Overview

This project analyzes Amazon’s sales data from 2014 to 2018 to identify key revenue and profit drivers across products, sales channels, and geographic regions. The analysis uncovers seasonal trends, detects outliers, and benchmarks actual performance against budget targets. Insights from the study are used to inform pricing and promotional strategies, guide market expansion decisions, and support sustainable growth while reducing concentration risk.

## Objectives

* Identify primary drivers of revenue and profitability by product, channel, and region
* Analyze seasonality and demand patterns over time
* Detect anomalies and outliers impacting performance
* Compare actual performance against budget targets
* Translate insights into actionable business recommendations

## Dataset

* **Time Period:** 2014–2018
* **Scope:** Sales, revenue, profit, budget targets
* **Dimensions:** Products, sales channels, regions, time (monthly/quarterly)
* **Source:** Internal Amazon sales data (anonymized / simulated for analysis purposes, if applicable)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**

   * Data cleaning and validation
   * Handling missing values and outliers
   * Feature engineering for time-based analysis (year, quarter, season)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Revenue and profit trends over time
   * Product- and category-level performance analysis
   * Channel and regional comparisons

3. **Seasonality & Trend Analysis**

   * Identification of peak and off-peak sales periods
   * Year-over-year growth analysis

4. **Budget Benchmarking**

   * Comparison of actuals vs. budget targets
   * Variance analysis to highlight over- and under-performance

5. **Insight Generation & Recommendations**

   * Pricing and promotion optimization opportunities
   * Market expansion and diversification insights
   * Risk reduction strategies related to revenue concentration

## Key Findings

* A small subset of products and regions accounted for a disproportionate share of revenue and profit, indicating concentration risk.
* Strong seasonality was observed, with consistent peaks during major shopping periods.
* Certain channels outperformed budget expectations due to effective promotional strategies.
* Underperforming regions showed potential for growth through targeted pricing and marketing adjustments.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn / Power BI 
* **Reporting:** Jupyter Notebook, Excel

## Results & Impact

* Improved understanding of revenue and profit drivers
* Data-driven recommendations for pricing and promotions
* Insights to support strategic market expansion
* Identification of actions to reduce over-reliance on specific products or regions
* Customer Segmentation

## How to Use This Project
